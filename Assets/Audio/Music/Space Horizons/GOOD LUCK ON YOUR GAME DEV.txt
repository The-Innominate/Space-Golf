Hi,
Thank you very much for downloading my music pack. Hope it will sound good on your game!
So basically each one of the songs here are loopable, and complement each others through recurrent themes.
So don't hesitate to use them in the key moments of your game, and the music names are actual indication on
how I imagined them being used for (but of course, let your creative mind come with some great and originals ideas).

And by the way, if you have any question/problem, or if you want to contact me to write a specific song for
your game, here is my e-mail: albin.zanin@gmail.com


Good luck on your game dev,
Albin ZANIN
