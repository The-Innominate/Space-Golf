# SpaceGolf - Coast to Coast™

![SpaceGolf Logo](placeholder-logo.png)

## What is SpaceGolf?

Space Golf - Coast to Coast™ is a physics-based puzzle-action mobile game where you slingshot a ball through space, dodging black holes, bouncing off planets, and pulling off orbital trick shots. It's simple to pick up, but if you want to master it? Good luck.

**"One ball. Infinite gravity. Master the chaos."**

## Features

### Gameplay
- **Swipe & Tap Controls** – Launch your ball, adjust trajectory, and let gravity do the work
- **Realistic Physics** – Slingshot around planets and black holes, but don't get sucked in
- **Multi-Path Levels** – Find your own way to the goal: fast and risky, or slow and calculated
- **Hazards & Challenges** – Asteroid belts, collapsing stars, wormholes, and moving targets

### Why You'll Love It
- **Satisfying Ball Physics** – Watching your ball zip through gravity wells never gets old
- **Challenge Modes** – Trick shots, survival runs, and infinite space mazes
- **Customization** – Unlock skins like meteor balls, plasma orbs, trails, and glowing void spheres
- **Leaderboard Competition** – Show off insane shots and beat your friends' best times
- **Power-Up Boosts** – Temporary trajectory previews or retries for when you need them

## How to Play

1. **Launch Your Ball** – Swipe to shoot it into space, swipe again to change trajectory
2. **Use Gravity to Your Advantage** – Aim for planets, time your bounces, and avoid the black holes
3. **Style on Everyone** – Pull off trick shots, speedruns, and dominate your friends
4. **Hit the Goal** – Sounds easy. It's not.
