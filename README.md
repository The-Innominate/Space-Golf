## What is SpaceGolf?
Space Golf is a physics based puzzle action mobile game where you slingshot

 a ball through space, dodging black holes, bouncing off planets, and pulling off orbital trick shots. It's simple to pick up, but if you want to master it? Good luck.

**"One ball. Infinite gravity. And a hole."**

## Features

### Gameplay
- **Swipe & Tap Controls** – Launch your ball, and let gravity do the work
- **Realistic Physics** – Slingshot around planets and black holes, but don't get sucked in
- **Multi-Path Levels** – Find your own way to the goal: fast and risky, or slow and calculated
- **Hazards & Challenges** – Asteroid belts, Suns, wormholes, and moving targets

## How to Play

1. **Launch Your Ball** – Swipe to shoot it into space
2. **Use Gravity to Your Advantage** – Aim for planets, time your bounces, and avoid the black holes
3. **Style on Everyone** – Pull off trick shots, speedruns, and dominate your friends
4. **Hit the Goal** – Sounds easy. It's not.
